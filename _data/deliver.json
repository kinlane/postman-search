    "description": "My friend often call me instead of pressing my doorbell when they arrive, because I always miss the doorbell and left my guests outside, but how about postman or delivery service whom may not have my phone number? There are also special doorbell made for deafness people with lights alert, but it still can be missed easily, so I think it is time to reinvent doorbell.In this project, I am going to build an IoT doorbell .Once the visitor pressed the doorbell, it will publish and an alert will be sent, so I know someone is knocking my door no matter where I am. Visitors no longer need to call me and simply let the IoT doorbell to do the job, deafness people also benefit using it so they can alert from vibration of their phone.",
